          <div class="app-prose-scope"><h2 id="our-vision" tabindex="-1" class="govuk-heading-l">Our Vision</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">To provide a forum for multidisciplinary, public sector wide collaboration on cloud:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>To help each other in the adoption and maturation of our use of cloud</li>
<li>To share case studies, and lessons learned</li>
<li>To discover and evaluate emerging trends in cloud usage</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="our-terms-of-reference---first-draft" tabindex="-1" class="govuk-heading-l">Our Terms of Reference - first draft</h2>
<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
<li>This is a brown field site. There are lots of existing committees, communities, collaborations, and centres of excellence in the public sector and this forum needs to add unique value to that set.</li>
<li>This community will be technically focused, complementing the communities focused on strategy, commercial management and FinOps.</li>
<li>This community will be public sector wide and inclusive of all individuals who participate in the design, build and support of cloud services.</li>
<li>All members are expected to participate in a “badgeless” way, focused on the goal of using cloud services to deliver better public services irrespective of who pays their wages.</li>
<li>This community will not be used for sales or procurement processes.</li>
<li>This community will not be an official decision making body, but it will be used for consultation on policy, strategy and guidance.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-are-we-doing-this%3F" tabindex="-1" class="govuk-heading-l">How are we doing this?</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">We are not sure what form this community needs to take; who the participants should be, and what content should be covered. There is a risk that this the content is not sufficiently unique or interesting for the group to endure.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">We hope to learn by doing.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">We are going to hold a series of monthly virtual calls to explore interesting topics that are potentially uniquely available in this forum.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">The three categories of uniquely interesting topics identified so far are:</p>
<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
<li>Public sector wide analysis and proposals that contain views and contributions from multiple organisations</li>
<li>The cloud journeys of individual organisations that would not be readily available to other organisations</li>
<li>Specific technical developments that might have a wider applicability but currently don’t have that visibility</li>
</ol>
<p class="govuk-body">Whilst we are in this early phease we are going to ask for a number of volunteers to form a planning and evaluation team, to help drive the content, evaluate the development of the community and shape its direction. If you want to be part of the planning and evalution group drop an email to the <a href="mailto:cloud-strategy@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk" class="govuk-link">GDS Cloud Strategy Team</a> and we’ll reach out.</p>
<h3 id="logistics" tabindex="-1" class="govuk-heading-m">Logistics</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">Virtual meetings will use Microsoft Teams because it is the product that has the widest availability across the public sector.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">GitHub will be used for this website</p>
<p class="govuk-body">MailChimp will be used to manage an email distribution list for announcement and sharing of presentation material. Material will also be available in a private GitHub repo</p>
<p class="govuk-body">There is no single instant messaging solution that works across the public sector. The best tool for a technical community is likely to be <a href="https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/" class="govuk-link">UK Government Digital</a> Slack - in the <a href="https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/archives/C04FA6GL49J" class="govuk-link">#cloud</a> channel. If you are new to Slack, <a href="https://x-govuk.github.io/posts/how-to-use-cross-government-slack/" class="govuk-link">this is a guide on how to use cross-government Slack</a>.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">In person meetings are an aspiration but there are not plans at this stage.</p>
